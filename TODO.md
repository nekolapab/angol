- [x] Remove duplicate files (screens/angol_screen.dart and "Claudes code")
- [x] Run flutter analyze (found some warnings but no errors)

- [x] App runs successfully on web server at http://localhost:44701

## Notes

- The app builds without errors.
- Some deprecation warnings exist (e.g., Color.value, withOpacity) but do not prevent functionality.
- Firebase services are integrated but may require proper Firebase project setup for full functionality.
- The hexagonal input system is now properly modularized into separate files for maintainability.
